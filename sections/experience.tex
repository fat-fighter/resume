            \item The objective was to implement robust Machine Learning models for anomaly detection in operations performed on large file servers
            \item Built a variant of the Holt-Winters Model for temporal based anomaly detection on per hour operation counts
            \item Implemented and used Collaborative Filtering for learning user behaviour using peer comparison for file access patterns

		\begin{cvitems}
			\item Built a lite calculator for customer margin allocation for proper internalization based on a waterfall logic, taking various parameters into consideration and a greedy strategy to allocate margin per stock, improving the run time of the allocation logic by tenfolds
			\item Introduced changes in existing models for asset liability gap management identifying bugs in pre-existing code and augmenting features for proper AL Gap Management for deposits and clearing house initial margin

		\begin{cvitems}
			\item Extracted image features from Ad creative images using OpenCV (in python) and Google Cloud Vision API to explain ad CTR
			\item Analysed Pearson Correlation, performed regression tests, and used variable selection (Weka) to detect explainable features 
			\item Created a python server to handle feature extraction and prediction for building suggestions for possible Ad enhancements based on CTR
