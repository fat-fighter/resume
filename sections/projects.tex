		\begin{cvitems}
		\item Surveyed continuous relaxations to discrete latent variables such as Gumbel-Softmax, Spike-and-Exp, Overlapping, Gumbolt, etc.
		\item Implemented GumBolt relaxation for binary latent variables with RBM prior using tensorflow and performed analysis on MNIST dataset
		\item Augmented GVAEs with binary latent embeddings to offer interpretable latent representations, imitating mixed membership models
		\item Tested the resultant model for link prediction on graph datasets such as Citeseer and Cora and achieved superior results to baseline models

	{Prof. Arnab Bhattacharya}
	{CS685: Data Mining}
	{
		\begin{cvitems}
		\item Proposed a novel model using the VAE framework for clustering in latent space, extending the ideas of the VaDE model
		\item Modeled the cluster assignment using a deep neural network, and added regularization using Virtual Adversarial training
		\item The proposed model worked comparable to VaDE on clustering tasks without the need for careful layer wise pretraining
		\item Extended the proposed model as a gating function for Mixture of Experts tasks and achieved better performance than naive baseline models

	{CS777: Statistical and Algorithmic Learning Theory}
	{
		\begin{cvitems}
		\item Two layer NNs can be represented as an ensemble of multiple single node hidden layer networks, which can be individually trained using generic boosting methods (gradient boosting), which also afford definite theoretical convergence guarantees
		\item Applied gradient boosting to train two layer networks incrementally and studied the convergence analysis under various constraints
		\item Implemented incremental NN training in python using sklearn, and applied for Softmax Regression on the MNIST Dataset
		\item Applied incremental training as pre-training, along with backpropagation for fine-tuning and observed remarkably better convergence
